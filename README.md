Software Based on Stellar Astrology - KP and KB

I am developing this project in my spare time using the following technologies

- Java
- Java Server Faces (Planning to use PrimeFaces) / HTML5
- Web Services
- Java Port of Swiss Ephemeris
- Planning to use Groovy also

This software would help Astrologers (not Astronomers :-)) following Krinamurthi Paddathi.
There are many free softwares available, like KPStarOne, Jyothishya Deepkika and
Jaganatha Hora to name a few. Primarly I would like to target Web Broswer and Mobile phones.

I am also interested in Bhaskar Astrology (popularly known as KB Astrology) by Sri. Bhasakaran, and would provide a module for it. 

Following is the plan:
1) Get basic Java or Groovy routines to create a basic Birth Chart and Horary chart.
2) Vimshottari Dasa
3) Calculation of Sub, Sub-Sub Lord
4) Module for KB Astrology
5) Calculating Aspects both Vedic and Western
6) Rules Engine to add rules for prediction
7) Module for Theory of Short Prediction
8) Module for 4-step theory
9) Module for Meena-2 (Jeeva and Sarerra) by Sri N V Raghava Chari
